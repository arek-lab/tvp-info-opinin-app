# TVP-Info RAG Explorer

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app for exploring media bias and thematic coverage in TVP-Info content.**  
This is a full-stack project built to demonstrate how a domain-specific RAG system can deliver fast, source-grounded answers over a large corpus of media articles.

> 🧪 This application is designed as a tech demo and proof of concept — showcasing the integration of RAG with a custom data pipeline and Angular frontend.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Angular 17**
- **Bootstrap 5 / SCSS**
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout
- Dynamic content rendering via bindings (e.g., rotating sample questions)

### Backend _(separate repo)_

> **Backend repo:** [🔗 INSERT_BACKEND_REPO_URL_HERE]

- **FastAPI** with async endpoints
- **RAG pipeline**:
  - Embedding model (OpenAI or local)
  - FAISS vector search
  - Prompt templating
- PDF + HTML article ingestion + preprocessing (custom pipeline)
- Caching & rate-limiting included

## 🧠 Core Idea

This app allows users to:

- Ask natural language questions about themes/topics covered by TVP-Info
- Retrieve relevant documents (from 80k+ articles)
- Get **citation-backed answers** generated by a language model using **retrieved context only**

Unlike general-purpose models (e.g., ChatGPT), this RAG approach:

- **Limits hallucinations** through explicit document grounding
- Provides **transparent sources** with inline references
- Supports **domain-specific insights** (media discourse, political framing, etc.)

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ⏱️ **<3s response time** (locally hosted or via OpenAI)
- 📚 **80,000+ indexed articles** from a single media source
- 🔍 Dense vector search via FAISS
- 📄 Citation-aware responses with extracted snippets
- 🧪 Designed for experimentation with prompt engineering / embedding tuning

---

## 🗂️ Use Cases

- Research on media bias and political communication
- Rapid prototyping of RAG-based question-answering systems
- Showcase project for AI/NLP engineering portfolio
- Internal tools for media analysts and editorial teams

🙋 About the Author

This project is part of my transition into AI-assisted business automation and NLP systems.
I'm currently exploring applied use cases of LLMs in domain-specific tasks, particularly in areas requiring high traceability, such as finance, media, and compliance.
